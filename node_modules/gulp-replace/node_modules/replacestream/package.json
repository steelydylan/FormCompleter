  "readme": "# replacestream\n\nA node.js through stream that does basic streaming text search and replace and\nis chunk boundary friendly.\n\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/eugeneware/replacestream.png)](http://travis-ci.org/eugeneware/replacestream)\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall via npm:\n\n``` shell\n$ npm install replacestream\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Search and replace over a test file\n\nSay we want to do a search and replace over the following file:\n\n```\n// happybirthday.txt\nHappy birthday to you!\nHappy birthday to you!\nHappy birthday to dear Liza!\nHappy birthday to you!\n```\n\n``` js\nvar replaceStream = require('replacestream')\n  , fs = require('fs')\n  , path = require('path');\n\n// Replace all the instances of 'birthday' with 'earthday'\nfs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'happybirthday.txt'))\n  .pipe(replaceStream('birthday', 'earthday'))\n  .pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nRunning this will print out:\n\n``` bash\n$ node simple.js\nHappy earthday to you!\nHappy earthday to you!\nHappy earthday to dear Liza!\nHappy earthday to you!\n```\n\nYou can also limit the number of replaces to first ```n```:\n\n``` js\n// Replace the first 2 of the instances of 'birthday' with 'earthday'\nfs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'happybirthday.txt'))\n  .pipe(replaceStream('birthday', 'earthday', { limit: 2 } ))\n  .pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nWhich would output:\n\n``` bash\n$ node simple.js\nHappy earthday to you!\nHappy earthday to you!\nHappy birthday to dear Liza!\nHappy birthday to you!\n```\n\nAnd you can also pass in a replacement function which will get called for each\nreplacement:\n\n``` js\n// Replace the word 'Happy' with a different word each time\nvar words = ['Awesome', 'Good', 'Super', 'Joyous'];\nfunction replaceFn(match) {\n  return words.shift();\n}\nfs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'happybirthday.txt'))\n  .pipe(replaceStream('Happy', replaceFn))\n  .pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nWhich would output:\n\n``` bash\n$ node simple.js\nAwesome birthday to you!\nGood birthday to you!\nSuper birthday to dear Liza!\nJoyous birthday to you!\n```\n\n### Search and replace with Regular Expressions\n\nHere's the same example, but with RegEx:\n\n```\n// happybirthday.txt\nHappy birthday to you!\nHappy birthday to you!\nHappy birthday to dear Liza!\nHappy birthday to you!\n```\n\n``` js\nvar replaceStream = require('replacestream')\n  , fs = require('fs')\n  , path = require('path');\n\n// Replace any word that has an 'o' with 'oh'\nfs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'happybirthday.txt'))\n  .pipe(replaceStream(/\\w*o\\w*/g, 'oh'))\n  .pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nRunning this will print out:\n\n``` bash\n$ node simple.js\nHappy birthday oh oh!\nHappy birthday oh oh!\nHappy birthday oh dear Liza!\nHappy birthday oh oh!\n```\n\nYou can also insert captures using the $1 ($index) notation. This is similar the built in method [replace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace#Specifying_a_string_as_a_parameter).\n\n```\n// happybirthday.txt\nHappy birthday to you!\nHappy birthday to you!\nHappy birthday to dear Liza!\nHappy birthday to you!\n```\n\n``` js\nvar replaceStream = require('replacestream')\n  , fs = require('fs')\n  , path = require('path');\n\n// Replace any word that has an 'o' with 'oh'\nfs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'happybirthday.txt'))\n  .pipe(replaceStream(/(dear) (Liza!)/, 'my very good and $1 friend $2'))\n  .pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nRunning this will print:\n\n``` bash\n$ node simple.js\nHappy birthday to you!\nHappy birthday to you!\nHappy birthday to my very good and dear friend Liza!\nHappy birthday to you!\n```\n\nYou can also pass in a replacement function. The function will be passed parameters just like [String.prototype.replace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) (e.g. replaceFunction(match, p1, p2, offset, string)). In this case the matched string is limited to the buffer the match is found on, not the entire stream.\n\n``` js\nfunction replaceFn() {\n  return arguments[2] + ' to ' + arguments[1]\n}\nfs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'happybirthday.txt'))\n  .pipe(replaceStream(/(birt\\w*)\\sto\\s(you)/g, replaceFn))\n  .pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nWhich would output:\n\n``` bash\n$ node simple.js\nHappy you to birthday!\nHappy you to birthday!\nHappy birthday to dear Liza!\nHappy you to birthday!\n```\n\n### Web server search and replace over a test file\n\nHere's the same example, but kicked off from a HTTP server:\n\n``` js\n// server.js\nvar http = require('http')\n  , fs = require('fs')\n  , path = require('path')\n  , replaceStream = require('replacestream');\n\nvar app = function (req, res) {\n  if (req.url.match(/^\\/happybirthday\\.txt$/)) {\n    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });\n    fs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'happybirthday.txt'))\n      .pipe(replaceStream('birthday', 'earthday'))\n      .pipe(res);\n  } else {\n    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });\n    res.end('File not found');\n  }\n};\nvar server = http.createServer(app).listen(3000);\n```\n\nWhen you request the file:\n```\n$ curl -i \"http://localhost:3000/happybirthday.txt\"\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/plain\nDate: Mon, 08 Jul 2013 06:45:21 GMT\nConnection: keep-alive\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\nHappy earthday to you!\nHappy earthday to you!\nHappy earthday to dear Liza!\nHappy earthday to you!\n```\n\nNB: If your readable Stream that you're piping through the `replacestream` is\npaused, then you may have to call the `.resume()` method on it.\n\n### Changing the encoding\n\nYou can also change the text encoding of the search and replace by setting an\nencoding property on the options object:\n\n``` js\n// Replace the first 2 of the instances of 'birthday' with 'earthday'\nfs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'happybirthday.txt'))\n  .pipe(replaceStream('birthday', 'earthday', { limit: 2, encoding: 'ascii' } ))\n  .pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nBy default the encoding will be set to 'utf8'.\n\n## Contributing\n\nreplacestream is an **OPEN Open Source Project**.
